"Due to the nature of delta kinematics, resonance frequencies can differ a "

"A note on vibration reduction: the values in the table above are "
"approximate. If the damping ratio of the printer is known for each axis, the"
" shaper can be configured more precisely and it will then reduce the "
"resonances in a bit wider range of frequencies. However, the damping ratio "
"is usually unknown and is hard to estimate without a special equipment, so "
"Klipper uses 0.1 value by default, which is a good all-round value. The "
"frequency ranges in the table cover a number of different possible damping "
"ratios around that value (approx. from 0.05 to 0.2)."

msgid ""
"Shaper duration affects the smoothing in parts - the larger it is, the more "
"smooth the parts are. This dependency is not linear, but can give a sense of"
" which shapers 'smooth' more for the same frequency. The ordering by "
"smoothing is like this: ZV < MZV < ZVD ≈ EI < 2HUMP_EI < 3HUMP_EI. Also, it "
"is rarely practical to set shaper_freq = resonance freq for shapers 2HUMP_EI"
" and 3HUMP_EI (they should be used to reduce vibrations for several "
"frequencies)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One can estimate a range of frequencies in which the shaper reduces "
"vibrations. For example, MZV with shaper_freq = 35 Hz reduces vibrations to "
"5% for frequencies [33.6, 36.4] Hz. 3HUMP_EI with shaper_freq = 50 Hz "
"reduces vibrations to 5% in range [27.5, 75] Hz."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One can use this table to check which shaper they should be using if they "
"need to reduce vibrations at several frequencies. For example, if one has "
"resonances at 35 Hz and 60 Hz on the same axis: a) EI shaper needs to have "
"shaper_freq = 35 / (1 - 0.2) = 43.75 Hz, and it will reduce resonances until"
" 43.75 * (1 + 0.2) = 52.5 Hz, so it is not sufficient; b) 2HUMP_EI shaper "
"needs to have shaper_freq = 35 / (1 - 0.35) = 53.85 Hz and will reduce "
"vibrations until 53.85 * (1 + 0.35) = 72.7 Hz - so this is an acceptable "
"configuration. Always try to use as high shaper_freq as possible for a given"
" shaper (perhaps with some safety margin, so in this example shaper_freq ≈ "
"50-52 Hz would work best), and try to use a shaper with as small shaper "
"duration as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If one needs to reduce vibrations at several very different frequencies "
