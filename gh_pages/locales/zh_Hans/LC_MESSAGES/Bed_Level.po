"Bed leveling (sometimes also referred to as \"bed tramming\") is critical to"
" getting high quality prints. If a bed is not properly \"leveled\" it can "
"lead to poor bed adhesion, \"warping\", and subtle problems throughout the "
"print. This document serves as a guide to performing bed leveling in "
"Klipper."
msgstr ""

"It's important to understand the goal of bed leveling. If the printer is "
"commanded to a position `X0 Y0 Z10` during a print, then the goal is for the"
" printer's nozzle to be exactly 10mm from the printer's bed. Further, should"
" the printer then be commanded to a position of `X50 Z10` the goal is for "
"the nozzle to maintain an exact distance of 10mm from the bed during that "
"entire horizontal move."
msgstr ""
"了解打印床调平的目标很重要。如果打印机在打印过程中被命令到`X0 Y0 "
"Z10`的位置，那么目标是让打印机的喷嘴距离打印床正好10毫米。此外，如果打印机被命令到`X50 "
"Z10`的位置，目标是在整个水平移动过程中，喷嘴与床面始终保持10毫米的准确距离。"

"In order to get good quality prints the printer should be calibrated so that"
" Z distances are accurate to within about 25 microns (.025mm). This is a "
"small distance - significantly smaller than the width of a typical human "
"hair. This scale can not be measured \"by eye\". Subtle effects (such as "
"heat expansion) impact measurements at this scale. The secret to getting "
"high accuracy is to use a repeatable process and to use a leveling method "
"that leverages the high accuracy of the printer's own motion system."
msgstr ""
"为了获得良好的打印质量，打印机应进行校准，使Z轴距离的精度在约25微米（0.025毫米）。这是一个很小的距离，远小于典型人类头发的宽度。这个尺度是不能 "
"\"用眼睛 \"来测量的。微妙的影响（如热膨胀）会影响这个尺度的测量。获得高精度的秘诀是使用一个可重复，高精度，并能够利用打印机自身运动系统的调平方法。"

"Different types of printers use different methods for performing bed "

"During calibration it may be necessary to set the printer's Z `position_min`"
" to a negative number (eg, `position_min = -2`). The printer enforces "
"boundary checks even during calibration routines. Setting a negative number "
"allows the printer to move below the nominal position of the bed, which may "

msgstr ""
"在校准过程中，可能需要将打印机的Z `position_min`设置为一个负数（例如，`position_min = "
"-2`）。即使在校准程序中，打印机也会执行边界检查。设置一个负数允许打印机在打印床的标称位置以下移动，这可以帮助确定实际床面位置。"

msgid "The \"paper test\""
msgstr "“A4纸测试法”"

msgid ""
"The primary bed calibration mechanism is the \"paper test\". It involves "
"placing a regular piece of \"copy machine paper\" between the printer's bed "
"and nozzle, and then commanding the nozzle to different Z heights until one "
"feels a small amount of friction when pushing the paper back and forth."
msgstr ""
"床调平的核心校准机制是\"塞纸测试\"。它涉及在打印床和喷嘴之间放置一张普通打印纸，然后将喷嘴控制到不同的Z高度，直到在来回移动纸张时感觉到适量的阻力。"

msgid ""
"It is important to understand the \"paper test\" even if one has an "
"\"automatic Z probe\". The probe itself often needs to be calibrated to get "
"good results. That probe calibration is done using this \"paper test\"."
msgstr "即使你的打印机带有自动Z探针，理解塞纸测试依然很重要。为了保证探针的效果，它经常会需要校准。探针的校准机制也依赖塞纸测试。"

msgid ""
"The first step of the paper test is to inspect the printer's nozzle and bed."
" Make sure there is no plastic (or other debris) on the nozzle or bed."
msgstr "纸张测试的第一步是检查打印机的喷嘴和打印床。确保喷嘴和打印床面上没有塑料（或其他杂物）。"

msgid ""
"If there is plastic on the nozzle then heat up the extruder and use a metal "
"tweezers to remove that plastic. Wait for the extruder to fully cool to room"
" temperature before continuing with the paper test. While the nozzle is "
"cooling, use the metal tweezers to remove any plastic that may ooze out."
msgstr ""
"如果喷嘴上残留了塑料，需要先加热挤出头并用金属镊子把这些塑料去除。等到挤出机完全冷却到室温后，再继续进行纸张测试。当喷嘴正在冷却时，使用金属镊子去除任何可能漏出的塑料。"

msgid ""
"**Always perform the paper test when both nozzle and bed are at room "
"temperature!**"
msgstr "**只在喷嘴和打印床都处于室温的情况下进行塞纸测试！**"

msgid ""
"It may seem odd to calibrate the distance at room temperature when the goal "
"is to have a consistent distance when heated. However, if one calibrates "
"when the nozzle is heated, it tends to impart small amounts of molten "
"plastic on to the paper, which changes the amount of friction felt. That "
"makes it harder to get a good calibration. Calibrating while the bed/nozzle "
"is hot also greatly increases the risk of burning oneself. The amount of "
"thermal expansion is stable, so it is easily accounted for later in the "
"calibration process."
msgstr ""
"当目标是在加热时有一个一致的距离时，在室温下校准距离可能听起来很奇怪。然而，如果在喷嘴加热时进行校准，往往会有少量的熔融塑料渗入纸张，从而改变了摩擦力的大小。这会影响校准精度。在床或喷嘴热的时候进行校准也会大大增加烧伤风险。热膨胀量是稳定的，所以在校准过程中很容易被考虑到。"

msgid ""
"Then a `TESTZ Z=-` would move the nozzle to a Z position of 0.180 (half way "

"0.130."
msgstr ""
"然后 `TESTZ Z=-` 会将喷嘴移动到 Z 坐标 0.180 （0.130 和 0.230之间）。这个功能可以快速的找到一致阻力的位置。也可以用 "
