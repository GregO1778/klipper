"When discussing benefits it is preferable to discuss \"facts and "
"measurements\". In general, reviewers are not looking for responses of the "
"form \"someone may find option X useful\", nor are they looking for "
"responses of the form \"this submission adds a feature that firmware X "
"implements\". Instead, it is generally preferable to discuss details on how "
"the quality improvement was measured and what were the results of those "
"measurements - for example, \"tests on Acme X1000 printers show improved "
"corners as seen in picture ...\", or for example \"print time of real-world "
"object X on a Foomatic X900 printer went from 4 hours to 3.5 hours\". It is "
"understood that testing of this type can take significant time and effort. "
"Some of Klipper's most notable features took months of discussion, rework, "
"testing, and documentation prior to being merged into the master branch."
