"[Input shaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_shaping) is an open-loop"
" control technique which creates a commanding signal that cancels its own "
"vibrations. Input shaping requires some tuning and measurements before it "

" configured from different considerations to reduce several resonances at "

msgstr ""

msgid "A few notes on shaper selection:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"EI shaper may be more suited for bed slinger printers (if the resonance "
"frequency and resulting smoothing allows): as more filament is deposited on "
"the moving bed, the mass of the bed increases and the resonance frequency "
"will decrease. Since EI shaper is more robust to resonance frequency "
"changes, it may work better when printing large parts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to the nature of delta kinematics, resonance frequencies can differ a "
"lot in different parts of the build volume. Therefore, EI shaper can be a "
"better fit for delta printers rather than MZV or ZV, and should be "
"considered for the use. If the resonance frequency is sufficiently large "
"(more than 50-60 Hz), then one can even attempt to test 2HUMP_EI shaper (by "
"running the suggested test above with `SET_INPUT_SHAPER "
"SHAPER_TYPE=2HUMP_EI`), but check the considerations in the [section "
"below](#selecting-max_accel) before enabling it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Selecting max_accel"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to select a suitable max_accel value, inspect the model for the "
"chosen input shaper. First, take a note at which acceleration ringing is "
"still small - that you are comfortable with it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, check the smoothing. To help with that, the test model has a small gap"
" in the wall (0.15 mm):"
msgstr ""

msgid "![Test gap](img/smoothing-test.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As the acceleration increases, so does the smoothing, and the actual gap in "
"the print widens:"
msgstr ""

msgid "![Shaper smoothing](img/shaper-smoothing.jpg)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this picture, the acceleration increases left to right, and the gap "
"starts to grow starting from 3500 mm/sec^2 (5-th band from the left). So the"
" good value for max_accel = 3000 (mm/sec^2) in this case to avoid the "
"excessive smoothing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note the acceleration when the gap is still very small in your test print. "
"If you see bulges, but no gap in the wall at all, even at high "
"accelerations, it may be due to disabled Pressure Advance, especially on "
"Bowden extruders. If that is the case, you may need to repeat the print with"
" the PA enabled. It may also be a result of a miscalibrated (too high) "
"filament flow, so it is a good idea to check that too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a note, it may happen - especially at low ringing frequencies - that EI "
"shaper will cause too much smoothing even at lower accelerations. In this "
"case, MZV may be a better choice, because it may allow higher acceleration "
"values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At very low ringing frequencies (~25 Hz and below) even MZV shaper may "
"create too much smoothing. If that is the case, you can also try to repeat "
"the steps in [Choosing input shaper](#choosing-input-shaper) section with ZV"
" shaper, by using `SET_INPUT_SHAPER SHAPER_TYPE=ZV` command instead. ZV "
"shaper should show even less smoothing than MZV, but is more sensitive to "
"errors in measuring the ringing frequencies."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another consideration is that if a resonance frequency is too low (below "
"20-25 Hz), it might be a good idea to increase the printer stiffness or "
"reduce the moving mass. Otherwise, acceleration and printing speed may be "
"limited due too much smoothing now instead of ringing."
