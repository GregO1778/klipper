msgid "G-Code Macro Naming"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Case is not important for the G-Code macro name - MY_MACRO and my_macro will"
" evaluate the same and may be called in either upper or lower case. If any "
"numbers are used in the macro name then they must all be at the end of the "
"name (eg, TEST_MACRO25 is valid, but MACRO25_TEST3 is not)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Formatting of G-Code in the config"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Indentation is important when defining a macro in the config file. To "
"specify a multi-line G-Code sequence it is important for each line to have "
"proper indentation. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note how the `gcode:` config option always starts at the beginning of the "
"line and subsequent lines in the G-Code macro never start at the beginning."
msgstr ""

msgid "Add a description to your macro"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To help identify the functionality a short description can be added. Add "
"`description:` with a short text to describe the functionality. Default is "
"\"G-Code macro\" if not specified. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Save/Restore state for G-Code moves"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unfortunately, the G-Code command language can be challenging to use. The "
"standard mechanism to move the toolhead is via the `G1` command (the `G0` "
"command is an alias for `G1` and it can be used interchangeably with it). "
"However, this command relies on the \"G-Code parsing state\" setup by `M82`,"
" `M83`, `G90`, `G91`, `G92`, and previous `G1` commands. When creating a "
"G-Code macro it is a good idea to always explicitly set the G-Code parsing "
"state prior to issuing a `G1` command. (Otherwise, there is a risk the `G1` "
"command will make an undesirable request.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A common way to accomplish that is to wrap the `G1` moves in "
"`SAVE_GCODE_STATE`, `G91`, and `RESTORE_GCODE_STATE`. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `G91` command places the G-Code parsing state into \"relative move "
"mode\" and the `RESTORE_GCODE_STATE` command restores the state to what it "
"was prior to entering the macro. Be sure to specify an explicit speed (via "
"the `F` parameter) on the first `G1` command."
msgstr ""

msgid "Template expansion"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The gcode_macro `gcode:` config section is evaluated using the Jinja2 "
"template language. One can evaluate expressions at run-time by wrapping them"
" in `{ }` characters or use conditional statements wrapped in `{% %}`. See "
"the [Jinja2 documentation](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/) for "
"further information on the syntax."
msgstr ""

msgid "An example of a complex macro:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Macro parameters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is often useful to inspect parameters passed to the macro when it is "
"called. These parameters are available via the `params` pseudo-variable. For"
" example, if the macro:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"were invoked as `SET_PERCENT VALUE=.2` it would evaluate to `M117 Now at "
"20%`. Note that parameter names are always in upper-case when evaluated in "
"the macro and are always passed as strings. If performing math then they "
"must be explicitly converted to integers or floats."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's common to use the Jinja2 `set` directive to use a default parameter and"
" assign the result to a local name. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The \"printer\" Variable"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible to inspect (and alter) the current state of the printer via "
"the `printer` pseudo-variable. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Available fields are defined in the [Status Reference](Status_Reference.md) "
"document."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Important! Macros are first evaluated in entirety and only then are the "
"resulting commands executed. If a macro issues a command that alters the "
"state of the printer, the results of that state change will not be visible "
"during the evaluation of the macro. This can also result in subtle behavior "
"when a macro generates commands that call other macros, as the called macro "
"is evaluated when it is invoked (which is after the entire evaluation of the"
" calling macro)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By convention, the name immediately following `printer` is the name of a "
"config section. So, for example, `printer.fan` refers to the fan object "
"created by the `[fan]` config section. There are some exceptions to this "
"rule - notably the `gcode_move` and `toolhead` objects. If the config "
"section contains spaces in it, then one can access it via the `[ ]` accessor"
" - for example: `printer[\"generic_heater my_chamber_heater\"].temperature`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the Jinja2 `set` directive can assign a local name to an object in"
" the `printer` hierarchy. This can make macros more readable and reduce "
"typing. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Actions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are some commands available that can alter the state of the printer. "
"For example, `{ action_emergency_stop() }` would cause the printer to go "
"into a shutdown state. Note that these actions are taken at the time that "
"the macro is evaluated, which may be a significant amount of time before the"
" generated g-code commands are executed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Available \"action\" commands:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`action_respond_info(msg)`: Write the given `msg` to the /tmp/printer "
"pseudo-terminal. Each line of `msg` will be sent with a \"// \" prefix."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`action_raise_error(msg)`: Abort the current macro (and any calling macros) "
"and write the given `msg` to the /tmp/printer pseudo-terminal. The first "
"line of `msg` will be sent with a \"!! \" prefix and subsequent lines will "
"have a \"// \" prefix."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`action_emergency_stop(msg)`: Transition the printer to a shutdown state. "
"The `msg` parameter is optional, it may be useful to describe the reason for"
" the shutdown."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Variables"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The SET_GCODE_VARIABLE command may be useful for saving state between macro "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
