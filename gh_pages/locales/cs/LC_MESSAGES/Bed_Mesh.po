"The Bed Mesh module may be used to compensate for bed surface irregularties "
"to achieve a better first layer across the entire bed. It should be noted "
"that software based correction will not achieve perfect results, it can only"
" approximate the shape of the bed. Bed Mesh also cannot compensate for "
"mechanical and electrical issues. If an axis is skewed or a probe is not "
"accurate then the bed_mesh module will not receive accurate results from the"
" probing process."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`mesh_radius: 75` *Required* The radius of the probed mesh in mm, relative "
"to the `mesh_origin`. Note that the probe's offsets limit the size of the "
"mesh radius. In this example, a radius larger than 76 would move the tool "
"beyond the range of the printer."

"defines the maximum number of probed points along the X and Y axes. By "
"\"maximum\", we mean the number of points probed along the mesh origin. This"
" value must be an odd number, as it is required that the center of the mesh "

msgstr ""

msgid "Mesh Interpolation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While its possible to sample the probed matrix directly using simple "
"bilinear interpolation to determine the Z-Values between probed points, it "
"is often useful to interpolate extra points using more advanced "
"interpolation algorithms to increase mesh density. These algorithms add "
"curvature to the mesh, attempting to simulate the material properties of the"
" bed. Bed Mesh offers lagrange and bicubic interpolation to accomplish this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`algorithm: lagrange` *Default Value: lagrange* The algorithm used to "
"interpolate the mesh. May be `lagrange` or `bicubic`. Lagrange interpolation"
" is capped at 6 probed points as oscillation tends to occur with a larger "
"number of samples. Bicubic interpolation requires a minimum of 4 probed "
"points along each axis, if less than 4 points are specified then lagrange "
"sampling is forced. If `mesh_pps` is set to 0 then this value is ignored as "
"no mesh interpolation is done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`bicubic_tension: 0.2` *Default Value: 0.2* If the `algorithm` option is set"
" to bicubic it is possible to specify the tension value. The higher the "
"tension the more slope is interpolated. Be careful when adjusting this, as "
"higher values also create more overshoot, which will result in interpolated "
"values higher or lower than your probed points."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The illustration below shows how the options above are used to generate an "
"interpolated mesh."
msgstr ""

msgid "![bedmesh_interpolated](img/bedmesh_interpolated.svg)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Move Splitting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`move_check_distance: 5` *Default Value: 5* The minimum distance to check "
"for the desired change in Z before performing a split. In this example, a "
"move longer than 5mm will be traversed by the algorithm. Each 5mm a mesh Z "
"lookup will occur, comparing it with the Z value of the previous move. If "
"the delta meets the threshold set by `split_delta_z`, the move will be split"
" and traversal will continue. This process repeats until the end of the move"
" is reached, where a final adjustment will be applied. Moves shorter than "
"the `move_check_distance` have the correct Z adjustment applied directly to "
"the move without traversal or splitting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`split_delta_z: .025` *Default Value: .025* As mentioned above, this is the "
"minimum deviation required to trigger a move split. In this example, any Z "
"value with a deviation +/- .025mm will trigger a split."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generally the default values for these options are sufficient, in fact the "
"default value of 5mm for the `move_check_distance` may be overkill. However "
"an advanced user may wish to experiment with these options in an effort to "
"squeeze out the optimial first layer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Mesh Fade"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When \"fade\" is enabled Z adjustment is phased out over a distance defined "
"by the configuration. This is accomplished by applying small adjustments to "
"the layer height, either increasing or decreasing depending on the shape of "
"the bed. When fade has completed, Z adjustment is no longer applied, "
"allowing the top of the print to be flat rather than mirror the shape of the"
" bed. Fade also may have some undesirable traits, if you fade too quickly it"
" can result in visible artifacts on the print. Also, if your bed is "
"significantly warped, fade can shrink or stretch the Z height of the print. "
"As such, fade is disabled by default."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`fade_start: 1` *Default Value: 1* The Z height in which to start phasing "
"out adjustment. It is a good idea to get a few layers down before starting "
"the fade process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`fade_end: 10` *Default Value: 0* The Z height in which fade should "
"complete. If this value is lower than `fade_start` then fade is disabled. "
"This value may be adjusted depending on how warped the print surface is. A "
"significantly warped surface should fade out over a longer distance. A near "
"flat surface may be able to reduce this value to phase out more quickly. "
"10mm is a sane value to begin with if using the default value of 1 for "
"`fade_start`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`fade_target: 0` *Default Value: The average Z value of the mesh* The "
"`fade_target` can be thought of as an additional Z offset applied to the "
"entire bed after fade completes. Generally speaking we would like this value"
" to be 0, however there are circumstances where it should not be. For "
"example, lets assume your homing position on the bed is an outlier, its .2 "
"mm lower than the average probed height of the bed. If the `fade_target` is "
"0, fade will shrink the print by an average of .2 mm across the bed. By "
"setting the `fade_target` to .2, the homed area will expand by .2 mm, "
"however the rest of the bed will have an accurately sized. Generally its a "
"good idea to leave `fade_target` out of the configuration so the average "
"height of the mesh is used, however it may be desirable to manually adjust "
"the fade target if one wants to print on a specific portion of the bed."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Relative Reference Index"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most probes are suceptible to drift, ie: inaccuracies in probing introduced "
"by heat or interference. This can make calculating the probe's z-offset "
"challenging, particuarly at different bed temperatures. As such, some "
"printers use an endstop for homing the Z axis, and a probe for calibrating "
"the mesh. These printers can benefit from configuring the relative reference"
" index."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`relative_reference_index: 7` *Default Value: None (disabled)* When the "
"probed points are generated they are each assigned an index. You can look up"
" this index in klippy.log or by using BED_MESH_OUTPUT (see the section on "
"Bed Mesh GCodes below for more information). If you assign an index to the "
"`relative_reference_index` option, the value probed at this coordinate will "
"replace the probe's z_offset. This effectively makes this coordinate the "
"\"zero\" reference for the mesh."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using the relative reference index, you should choose the index nearest"
" to the spot on the bed where Z endstop calibration was done. Note that when"
" looking up the index using the log or BED_MESH_OUTPUT, you should use the "
"coordinates listed under the \"Probe\" header to find the correct index."
msgstr ""

msgid "Faulty Regions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible for some areas of a bed to report inaccurate results when "
"probing due to a \"fault\" at specific locations. The best example of this "
"are beds with series of integrated magnets used to retain removable steel "
"sheets. The magnetic field at and around these magnets may cause an "
"inductive probe to trigger at a distance higher or lower than it would "
"otherwise, resulting in a mesh that does not accurately represent the "
"surface at these locations. **Note: This should not be confused with probe "
"location bias, which produces inaccurate results across the entire bed.**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `faulty_region` options may be configured to compensate for this affect."
" If a generated point lies within a faulty region bed mesh will attempt to "
"probe up to 4 points at the boundaries of this region. These probed values "
"will be averaged and inserted in the mesh as the Z value at the generated "
"(X, Y) coordinate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`faulty_region_{1...99}_min` `faulty_region_{1..99}_max` *Default Value: "
"None (disabled)* Faulty Regions are defined in a way similar to that of mesh"
" itself, where minimum and maximum (X, Y) coordinates must be specified for "
"each region. A faulty region may extend outside of a mesh, however the "
"alternate points generated will always be within the mesh boundary. No two "
"regions may overlap."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The image below illustrates how replacement points are generated when a "
"generated point lies within a faulty region. The regions shown match those "
"in the sample config above. The replacement points and their coordinates are"
" identified in green."
