"Many of today's popular controller boards ship with a bootloader capable of "
"updating firmware via SD Card. While this is convenient in many "
"circumstances, these bootloaders typically provide no other way to update "
"firmware. This can be a nuisance if your board is mounted in a location that"
" is difficult to access or if you need to update firmware often. After "
"Klipper has been initially flashed to a controller it is possible to "
"transfer new firmware to the SD Card and initiate the flashing procedure via"
" ssh."
msgstr ""

msgid "Typical Upgrade Procedure"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The procedure for updating MCU firmware using the SD Card is similar to that"
" of other methods. Instead of using `make flash` it is necessary to run a "
"helper script, `flash-sdcard.sh`. Updating a BigTreeTech SKR 1.3 might look "
"like the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is up to the user to determine the device location and board name. If a "
"user needs to flash multiple boards, `flash-sdcard.sh` (or `make flash` if "
"appropriate) should be run for each board prior to restarting the Klipper "
"service."
msgstr ""

msgid "Supported boards can be listed with the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you do not see your board listed it may be necessary to add a new board "
"definition as [described below](#board-definitions)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Advanced Usage"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above commands assume that your MCU connects at the default baud rate of"
" 250000 and the firmware is located at `~/klipper/out/klipper.bin`. The "
"`flash-sdcard.sh` script provides options for changing these defaults. All "
"options can be viewed by the help screen:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your board is flashed with firmware that connects at a custom baud rate "
"it is possible to upgrade by specifying the `-b` option:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you wish to flash a build of Klipper located somewhere other than the "
"default location it can be done by specifying the `-f` option:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that when upgrading a MKS Robin E3 it is not necessary to manually run "
"`update_mks_robin.py` and supply the resulting binary to `flash-sdcard.sh`. "
"This procedure is automated during the upload process."
msgstr ""

msgid "Caveats"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As mentioned in the introduction, this method only works for upgrading "
"firmware. The initial flashing procedure must be done manually per the "
"instructions that apply to your controller board."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While it is possible to flash a build that changes the Serial Baud or "
"connection interface (ie: from USB to UART), verification will always fail "
"as the script will be unable to reconnect to the MCU to verify the current "
"version."
msgstr ""

msgid "Board Definitions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most common boards should be available, however it is possible to add a new "
"board definition if necessary. Board definitions are located in "
"`~/klipper/scripts/spi_flash/board_defs.py`. The definitions are stored in "
"dictionary, for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The following fields may be specified:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`mcu`: The mcu type. This can be retrevied after configuring the build via "
"`make menuconfig` by running `cat .config | grep CONFIG_MCU`. This field is "
"required."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`spi_bus`: The SPI bus connected to the SD Card. This should be retreived "
"from the board's schematic. This field is required."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`cs_pin`: The Chip Select Pin connected to the SD Card. This should be "
"retreived from the board schematic. This field is required."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`firmware_path`: The path on the SD Card where firmware should be "
"transferred. The default is `firmware.bin`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`spi_pins`: This should be 3 comma separated pins that are connected to the "
"SD Card in the format of `miso,mosi,sclk`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Prior to creating a new board definition one should check to see if an "
"existing board definition meets the criteria necessary for the new board. If"
" this is the case, a `BOARD_ALIAS` may be specified. For example, the "
"following alias may be added to specify `my-new-board` as an alias for "
"`generic-lpc1768`:"
