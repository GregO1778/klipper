"The `generic` prefix is used for a 3d printer board that may be used in many"
" different types of printers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `kit` prefix is for 3d printers that are assembled according to a widely"
" used specification. These \"kit\" printers are generally distinct from "
"normal \"printers\" in that they are not sold by a manufacturer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `sample` prefix is used for config \"snippets\" that one may copy-and-"
"paste into the main config file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `example` prefix is used to describe printer kinematics. This type of "
"config is typically only added along with code for a new type of printer "
"kinematics."

"Klipper must be able to start `printer`, `generic`, and `kit` example config"
" file without error. These config files should be added to the "
"[test/klippy/printers.test](../test/klippy/printers.test) regression test "
"case. Add new config files to that test case in the appropriate section and "
"in alphabetical order within that section."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The example configuration should be for the \"stock\" configuration of the "
"printer. (There are too many \"customized\" configurations to track in the "
"main Klipper repository.) Similarly, we only add example config files for "
"printers, kits, and boards that have mainstream popularity (eg, there should"
" be at least a 100 of them in active use). Consider using the [Klipper "
"Community Discourse server](https://community.klipper3d.org) for other "

"Only specify those devices present on the given printer or board. Do not "
"specify settings specific to your particular setup.For `generic` config "
"files, only those devices on the mainboard should be described. For example,"
" it would not make sense to add a display config section to a \"generic\" "
"config as there is no way to know if the board will be attached to that type"
" of display. If the board has a specific hardware port to facilitate an "
"optional peripheral (eg, a bltouch port) then one can add a \"commented "
"out\" config section for the given device."

msgid ""
"Do not specify `pressure_advance` in an example config, as that value is "
"specific to the filament, not the printer hardware. Similarly, do not "
"specify `max_extrude_only_velocity` nor `max_extrude_only_accel` settings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do not specify a config section containing a host path or host hardware. For"
" example, do not specify `[virtual_sdcard]` nor `[temperature_host]` config "
"sections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Only define macros that utilize functionality specific to the given printer "
"or to define g-codes that are commonly emitted by slicers configured for the"
" given printer."

"Where possible, it is best to use the same wording, phrasing, indentation, "
"and section ordering as the existing config files.The top of each config "
"file should list the type of micro-controller the user should select during "
"\"make menuconfig\". It should also have a reference to "
"\"docs/Config_Reference.md\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do not copy the field documentation into the example config files. (Doing so"
" creates a maintenance burden as an update to the documentation would then "
"require changing it in many places.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Example config files should not contain a \"SAVE_CONFIG\" section. If "
"necessary, copy the relevant fields from the SAVE_CONFIG section to the "
"appropriate section in the main config area."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use `field: value` syntax instead of `field=value`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Avoid defining field values that are set to their default value. For "
"example, one should not specify `min_extrude_temp: 170` as that is already "
"the default value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Where possible, lines should not exceed 80 columns."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Avoid adding attribution or revision messages to the config files. (For "
"example, avoid adding lines like \"this file was created by ...\".) Place "
"attribution and change history in the git commit message."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do not disable a default safety system in an example config file. For "
"example, a config should not specify a custom `max_extrude_cross_section`. "
"Do not enable debugging features. For example there should not be a "
"`force_move` config section."
