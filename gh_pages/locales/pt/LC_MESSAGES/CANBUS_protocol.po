msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper uses only CAN 2.0A standard size CAN bus packets, which are limited "
"to 8 data bytes and an 11-bit CAN bus identifier. In order to support "
"efficient communication, each micro-controller is assigned at run-time a "
"unique 1-byte CAN bus nodeid (`canbus_nodeid`) for general Klipper command "
"and response traffic. Klipper command messages going from host to micro-"
"controller use the CAN bus id of `canbus_nodeid * 2 + 256`, while Klipper "
"response messages from micro-controller to host use `canbus_nodeid * 2 + 256"
" + 1`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each micro-controller has a factory assigned unique chip identifier that is "
"used during id assignment. This identifier can exceed the length of one CAN "
"packet, so a hash function is used to generate a unique 6-byte id "
"(`canbus_uuid`) from the factory id."

msgid "Admin messages"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Admin messages are used for id assignment. Admin messages sent from host to "
"micro-controller use the CAN bus id `0x3f0` and messages sent from micro-"
"controller to host use the CAN bus id `0x3f1`. All micro-controllers listen "
"to messages on id `0x3f0`; that id can be thought of as a \"broadcast "
"address\"."

msgid "Data Packets"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The packet data in messages using the node's receive CAN bus id "
"(`canbus_nodeid * 2 + 256`) are simply appended to a buffer, and when a "
"complete [mcu protocol message](Protocol.md) is found its contents are "
"parsed and processed. The data is treated as a byte stream - there is no "
"requirement for the start of a Klipper message block to align with the start"
" of a CAN bus packet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly, mcu protocol message responses are sent from micro-controller to "
"host by copying the message data into one or more packets with the node's "
"transmit CAN bus id (`canbus_nodeid * 2 + 256 + 1`)."
