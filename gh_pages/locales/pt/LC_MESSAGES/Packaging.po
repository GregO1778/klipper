"Klipper uses a C module to handle some kinematics calculations more quickly."
" This module needs to be compiled at packaging time to avoid introducing a "
"runtime dependency on a compiler. To compile the C module, run `python2 "
"klippy/chelper/__init__.py`."

msgid "Compiling python code"

msgid ""
"Many distributions have a policy of compiling all python code before "
"packaging to improve startup time. You can do this by running `python2 -m "

msgid "Versioning"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are building a package of Klipper from git, it is usual practice not "
"to ship a .git directory, so the versioning must be handled without git. To "
"do this, use the script shipped in `scripts/make_version.py` which should be"
" run as follows: `python2 scripts/make_version.py YOURDISTRONAME > "
"klippy/.version`."
