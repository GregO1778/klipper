"The designers of your 3d printer originally calculated `steps_per_mm` from a"
" rotation distance. If you know the steps_per_mm then it is possible to use "
"this general formula to obtain that original rotation distance:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Or, if you have an older Klipper configuration and know the `step_distance` "
"parameter you can use this formula:"

msgid ""
"The `<full_steps_per_rotation>` setting is determined from the type of "
"stepper motor. Most stepper motors are \"1.8 degree steppers\" and therefore"
" have 200 full steps per rotation (360 divided by 1.8 is 200). Some stepper "
"motors are \"0.9 degree steppers\" and thus have 400 full steps per "
"rotation. Other stepper motors are rare. If unsure, do not set "
"full_steps_per_rotation in the config file and use 200 in the formula above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `<microsteps>` setting is determined by the stepper motor driver. Most "
"drivers use 16 microsteps. If unsure, set `microsteps: 16` in the config and"

msgid "Calibrating rotation_distance on extruders"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On an extruder, the `rotation_distance` is the amount of distance the "
"filament travels for one full rotation of the stepper motor. The best way to"
" get an accurate value for this setting is to use a \"measure and trim\" "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First start with an initial guess for the rotation distance. This may be "
"obtained from [steps_per_mm](#obtaining-rotation_distance-from-steps_per_mm-"
"or-step_distance) or by [inspecting the hardware](#extruder)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Then use the following procedure to \"measure and trim\":"

"Use a marker to place a mark on the filament around 70mm from the intake of "
"the extruder body. Then use a digital calipers to measure the actual "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the digital calipers to measure the new distance between the extruder "
"body and the mark on the filament. Note this as "
"`<subsequent_mark_distance>`. Then calculate: `actual_extrude_distance = "
"<initial_mark_distance> - <subsequent_mark_distance>`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Calculate rotation_distance as: `rotation_distance = "
"<previous_rotation_distance> * <actual_extrude_distance> / "
"<requested_extrude_distance>` Round the new rotation_distance to three "
"decimal places."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the actual_extrude_distance differs from requested_extrude_distance by "
"more than about 2mm then it is a good idea to perform the steps above a "
"second time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note: Do *not* use a \"measure and trim\" type of method to calibrate x, y, "
"or z type axes. The \"measure and trim\" method is not accurate enough for "
"those axes and will likely lead to a worse configuration. Instead, if "
"needed, those axes can be determined by [measuring the belts, pulleys, and "
"lead screw hardware](#obtaining-rotation_distance-by-inspecting-the-"
"hardware)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Obtaining rotation_distance by inspecting the hardware"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's possible to calculate rotation_distance with knowledge of the stepper "
"motors and printer kinematics. This may be useful if the steps_per_mm is not"
" known or if designing a new printer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Belt driven axes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is easy to calculate rotation_distance for a linear axis that uses a belt"
" and pulley."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First determine the type of belt. Most printers use a 2mm belt pitch (that "
"is, each tooth on the belt is 2mm apart). Then count the number of teeth on "
"the stepper motor pulley. The rotation_distance is then calculated as:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, if a printer has a 2mm belt and uses a pulley with 20 teeth, "
"then the rotation distance is 40."
msgstr ""

msgid "Axes with a lead screw"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is easy to calculate the rotation_distance for common lead screws using "
"the following formula:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the common \"T8 leadscrew\" has a rotation distance of 8 (it "
"has a pitch of 2mm and has 4 separate threads)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Older printers with \"threaded rods\" have only one \"thread\" on the lead "
"screw and thus the rotation distance is the pitch of the screw. (The screw "
"pitch is the distance between each groove on the screw.) So, for example, an"
" M6 metric rod has a rotation distance of 1 and an M8 rod has a rotation "
"distance of 1.25."
msgstr ""

msgid "Extruder"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's possible to obtain an initial rotation distance for extruders by "
"measuring the diameter of the \"hobbed bolt\" that pushes the filament and "
"using the following formula: `rotation_distance = <diameter> * 3.14`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the extruder uses gears then it will also be necessary to [determine and "
"set the gear_ratio](#using-a-gear_ratio) for the extruder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The actual rotation distance on an extruder will vary from printer to "
"printer, because the grip of the \"hobbed bolt\" that engages the filament "
"can vary. It can even vary between filament spools. After obtaining an "
"initial rotation_distance, use the [measure and trim "
"procedure](#calibrating-rotation_distance-on-extruders) to obtain a more "
"accurate setting."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using a gear_ratio"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting a `gear_ratio` can make it easier to configure the "
"`rotation_distance` on steppers that have a gear box (or similar) attached "
"to it. Most steppers do not have a gear box - if unsure then do not set "
"`gear_ratio` in the config."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When `gear_ratio` is set, the `rotation_distance` represents the distance "
"the axis moves with one full rotation of the final gear on the gear box. If,"
" for example, one is using a gearbox with a \"5:1\" ratio, then one could "
"calculate the rotation_distance with [knowledge of the hardware](#obtaining-"
"rotation_distance-by-inspecting-the-hardware) and then add `gear_ratio: 5:1`"
" to the config."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For gearing implemented with belts and pulleys, it is possible to determine "
"the gear_ratio by counting the teeth on the pulleys. For example, if a "
"stepper with a 16 toothed pulley drives the next pulley with 80 teeth then "
"one would use `gear_ratio: 80:16`. Indeed, one could open a common off the "
"shelf \"gear box\" and count the teeth in it to confirm its gear ratio."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that sometimes a gearbox will have a slightly different gear ratio than"
" what it is advertised as. The common BMG extruder motor gears are an "
"example of this - they are advertised as \"3:1\" but actually use \"50:17\" "
"gearing. (Using teeth numbers without a common denominator may improve "
"overall gear wear as the teeth don't always mesh the same way with each "
"revolution.) The common \"5.18:1 planetary gearbox\", is more accurately "
"configured with `gear_ratio: 57:11`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If several gears are used on an axis then it is possible to provide a comma "
"separated list to gear_ratio. For example, a \"5:1\" gear box driving a 16 "
"toothed to 80 toothed pulley could use `gear_ratio: 5:1, 80:16`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most cases, gear_ratio should be defined with whole numbers as common "
"gears and pulleys have a whole number of teeth on them. However, in cases "
"where a belt drives a pulley using friction instead of teeth, it may make "
"sense to use a floating point number in the gear ratio (eg, `gear_ratio: "
"107.237:16`)."
