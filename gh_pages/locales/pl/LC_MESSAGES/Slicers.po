"This document provides some tips for configuring a \"slicer\" application "
"for use with Klipper. Common slicers used with Klipper are Slic3r, Cura, "
"Simplify3D, etc."
msgstr ""
"Ten dokument zawiera wskazówki dotyczące konfiguracji aplikacji typu "
"\"slicer\" do użytku z Klipperem. Typowe slicery używane z Klipperem to "
"Slic3r, Cura, Simplify3D itp."

msgid "Set the G-Code flavor to Marlin"
msgstr "Ustaw G-Code na Marlin."

msgid ""
"Many slicers have an option to configure the \"G-Code flavor\". The default "
"is frequently \"Marlin\" and that works well with Klipper. The "
"\"Smoothieware\" setting also works well with Klipper."
msgstr ""
"Wiele slicerów ma opcję konfiguracji \"kodu G-Code\". Domyślnie często jest "
"\"Marlin\" i to działa dobrze z Klipperem. Ustawienie \"Smoothieware\" "
"również działa dobrze z Klipperem."

msgid "Klipper gcode_macro"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Slicers will often allow one to configure \"Start G-Code\" and \"End "
"G-Code\" sequences. It is often convenient to define custom macros in the "
"Klipper config file instead - such as: `[gcode_macro START_PRINT]` and "
"`[gcode_macro END_PRINT]`. Then one can just run START_PRINT and END_PRINT "
"in the slicer's configuration. Defining these actions in the Klipper "
"configuration may make it easier to tweak the printer's start and end steps "
"as changes do not require re-slicing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See [sample-macros.cfg](../config/sample-macros.cfg) for example START_PRINT"
" and END_PRINT macros."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the [config reference](Config_Reference.md#gcode_macro) for details on "
"defining a gcode_macro."

msgid "Large retraction settings may require tuning Klipper"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The maximum speed and acceleration of retraction moves are controlled in "
"Klipper by the `max_extrude_only_velocity` and `max_extrude_only_accel` "
"config settings. These settings have a default value that should work well "
"on many printers. However, if one has configured a large retraction in the "
"slicer (eg, 5mm or greater) then one may find they limit the desired speed "
"of retractions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If using a large retraction, consider tuning Klipper's [pressure "
"advance](Pressure_Advance.md) instead. Otherwise, if one finds the toolhead "
"seems to \"pause\" during retraction and priming, then consider explicitly "
"defining `max_extrude_only_velocity` and `max_extrude_only_accel` in the "
"Klipper config file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not enable \"coasting\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"coasting\" feature is likely to result in poor quality prints with "
"Klipper. Consider using Klipper's [pressure advance](Pressure_Advance.md) "
"instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Specifically, if the slicer dramatically changes the extrusion rate between "
"moves then Klipper will perform deceleration and acceleration between moves."
" This is likely to make blobbing worse, not better."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In contrast, it is okay (and often helpful) to use a slicer's \"retract\" "
"setting, \"wipe\" setting, and/or \"wipe on retract\" setting."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not use \"extra restart distance\" on Simplify3d"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This setting can cause dramatic changes to extrusion rates which can trigger"
" Klipper's maximum extrusion cross-section check. Consider using Klipper's "
"[pressure advance](Pressure_Advance.md) or the regular Simplify3d retract "
"setting instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disable \"PreloadVE\" on KISSlicer"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If using KISSlicer slicing software then set \"PreloadVE\" to zero. Consider"
" using Klipper's [pressure advance](Pressure_Advance.md) instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disable any \"advanced extruder pressure\" settings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some slicers advertise an \"advanced extruder pressure\" capability. It is "
"recommended to keep these options disabled when using Klipper as they are "
"likely to result in poor quality prints. Consider using Klipper's [pressure "
"advance](Pressure_Advance.md) instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Specifically, these slicer settings can instruct the firmware to make wild "
"changes to the extrusion rate in the hope that the firmware will approximate"
" those requests and the printer will roughly obtain a desirable extruder "
"pressure. Klipper, however, utilizes precise kinematic calculations and "
"timing. When Klipper is commanded to make significant changes to the "
"extrusion rate it will plan out the corresponding changes to velocity, "
"acceleration, and extruder movement - which is not the slicer's intent. The "
"slicer may even command excessive extrusion rates to the point that it "
"triggers Klipper's maximum extrusion cross-section check."
