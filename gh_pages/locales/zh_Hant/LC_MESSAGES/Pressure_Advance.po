"Typical pressure advance values are between 0.050 and 1.000 (the high end "

"典型的pressure advance值在 0.050 和 1.000 之間（高端通常只有鮑登擠出機）。如果壓力推進高達 1.000 "

"The pressure advance value is dependent on the extruder, the nozzle, and the"
" filament. It is common for filament from different manufactures or with "
"different pigments to require significantly different pressure advance "
"values. Therefore, one should calibrate pressure advance on each printer and"
" with each spool of filament."
msgstr ""
"Pressure advance值取決於擠出機、噴嘴和細絲。來自不同製造商或具有不同顏料的長絲通常需要顯著不同的pressure "
"advance值。因此，應該校準每台打印機上的pressure advance量以及每根燈絲捲軸。"

msgid ""
"Printing temperature and extrusion rates can impact pressure advance. Be "
"sure to tune the [extruder "
"rotation_distance](Rotation_Distance.md#calibrating-rotation_distance-on-"

"The test print is designed to run with a high extruder flow rate, but "
"otherwise \"normal\" slicer settings. A high flow rate is obtained by using "
"a high printing speed (eg, 100mm/s) and a coarse layer height (typically "
"around 75% of the nozzle diameter). Other slicer settings should be similar "
"to their defaults (eg, perimeters of 2 or 3 lines, normal retraction "
"amount). It can be useful to set the external perimeter speed to be the same"
" speed as the rest of the print, but it is not a requirement."
msgstr ""
"測試打印設計為以高擠出機流速運行，但否則為“正常”切片機設置。通過使用高打印速度（例如，100mm/s）和粗層高度（通常約為噴嘴直徑的 "
"75%）獲得高流速。其他切片器設置應與其默認設置相似（例如，2 或 3 "
"行的周長，正常的縮回量）。將外部周邊速度設置為與打印的其餘部分相同的速度可能很有用，但這不是必需的。"

msgid ""
"It is common for the test print to show different behavior on each corner. "
"Often the slicer will arrange to change layers at one corner which can "
"result in that corner being significantly different from the remaining three"
" corners. If this occurs, then ignore that corner and tune pressure advance "
"using the other three corners. It is also common for the remaining corners "
"to vary slightly. (This can occur due to small differences in how the "
"printer's frame reacts to cornering in certain directions.) Try to choose a "
"value that works well for all the remaining corners. If in doubt, prefer a "
"lower pressure advance value."
msgstr ""
"測試打印在每個角落顯示不同的行為是很常見的。通常，切片器會安排在一個角落更改圖層，這可能導致該角落與其餘三個角落明顯不同。如果發生這種情況，則忽略該角並使用其他三個角調整壓力推進。其餘的角也有輕微的變化也是很常見的。"
" （這可能是由於打印機框架對某些方向的拐角的反應存在微小差異。）嘗試選擇一個適用於所有剩餘拐角的值。如果有疑問，請選擇較低的pressure "
"advance值。"

msgid ""
"If a high pressure advance value (eg, over 0.200) is used then one may find "
"that the extruder skips when returning to the printer's normal acceleration."
" The pressure advance system accounts for pressure by pushing in extra "
"filament during acceleration and retracting that filament during "
"deceleration. With a high acceleration and high pressure advance the "
"extruder may not have enough torque to push the required filament. If this "
"occurs, either use a lower acceleration value or disable pressure advance."
msgstr ""
"如果使用高壓提前值（例如，超過 "
"0.200），則可能會發現擠出機在返回到打印機的正常加速度時會跳動。壓力推進系統通過在加速期間推入額外的燈絲並在減速期間縮回該燈絲來解釋壓力。在高加速度和高壓推進下，擠出機可能沒有足夠的扭矩來推動所需的長絲。如果發生這種情況，請使用較低的加速度值或禁用pressure"
" advance。"

msgid ""
"Once pressure advance is tuned in Klipper, it may still be useful to "
"configure a small retract value in the slicer (eg, 0.75mm) and to utilize "
"the slicer's \"wipe on retract option\" if available. These slicer settings "
"may help counteract ooze caused by filament cohesion (filament pulled out of"
" the nozzle due to the stickiness of the plastic). It is recommended to "
"disable the slicer's \"z-lift on retract\" option."
msgstr ""
"一旦在 Klipper 中調整了pressure advance，在切片器中配置一個小的縮回值（例如 0.75 "
"毫米）並使用切片器的“縮回時擦除選項”（如果可用）可能仍然有用。這些切片器設置可能有助於抵消由細絲內聚（由於塑料的粘性而從噴嘴中拉出細絲）引起的滲出。建議禁用切片器的“縮回時的"
" z-lift”選項。"

msgid ""
"The pressure advance system does not change the timing or path of the "
"toolhead. A print with pressure advance enabled will take the same amount of"
" time as a print without pressure advance. Pressure advance also does not "
"change the total amount of filament extruded during a print. Pressure "
"advance results in extra extruder movement during move acceleration and "
"deceleration. A very high pressure advance setting will result in a very "
"large amount of extruder movement during acceleration and deceleration, and "
"no configuration setting places a limit on the amount of that movement."
msgstr ""
"壓力推進系統不會改變工具頭的時間或路徑。啟用壓力推進的打印將花費與沒有壓力推進的打印相同的時間。pressure "
"advance也不會改變打印過程中擠出的長絲總量。在移動加速和減速過程中，pressure "
"advance會導致額外的擠出機移動。非常高的pressure "
"advance設置將導致擠出機在加速和減速過程中移動非常大，並且沒有配置設置對移動量進行限制。"
