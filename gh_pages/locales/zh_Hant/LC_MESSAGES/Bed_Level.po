"Bed leveling (sometimes also referred to as \"bed tramming\") is critical to"
" getting high quality prints. If a bed is not properly \"leveled\" it can "
"lead to poor bed adhesion, \"warping\", and subtle problems throughout the "
"print. This document serves as a guide to performing bed leveling in "
"Klipper."
msgstr ""
"列印床調平（有時也被稱為 \"bed "

"It's important to understand the goal of bed leveling. If the printer is "
"commanded to a position `X0 Y0 Z10` during a print, then the goal is for the"
" printer's nozzle to be exactly 10mm from the printer's bed. Further, should"
" the printer then be commanded to a position of `X50 Z10` the goal is for "
"the nozzle to maintain an exact distance of 10mm from the bed during that "
"entire horizontal move."
msgstr ""
"瞭解列印床調平的目標很重要。如果印表機在列印過程中被命令到`X0 Y0 "
"Z10`的位置，那麼目標是讓印表機的噴嘴距離列印床正好10毫米。此外，如果印表機被命令到`X50 "
"Z10`的位置，目標是在整個水平移動過程中，噴嘴與床面始終保持10毫米的準確距離。"

"In order to get good quality prints the printer should be calibrated so that"
" Z distances are accurate to within about 25 microns (.025mm). This is a "
"small distance - significantly smaller than the width of a typical human "
"hair. This scale can not be measured \"by eye\". Subtle effects (such as "
"heat expansion) impact measurements at this scale. The secret to getting "
"high accuracy is to use a repeatable process and to use a leveling method "
"that leverages the high accuracy of the printer's own motion system."
msgstr ""
"爲了獲得良好的列印質量，印表機應進行校準，使Z軸距離的精度在約25微米（0.025毫米）。這是一個很小的距離，遠小於典型人類頭髮的寬度。這個尺度是不能 "

"During calibration it may be necessary to set the printer's Z `position_min`"
" to a negative number (eg, `position_min = -2`). The printer enforces "

msgstr ""
"在校準過程中，可能需要將印表機的Z `position_min`設定為一個負數（例如，`position_min = "

msgid "The \"paper test\""
msgstr "「A4紙測試法」"

msgid ""
"The primary bed calibration mechanism is the \"paper test\". It involves "
"placing a regular piece of \"copy machine paper\" between the printer's bed "
"and nozzle, and then commanding the nozzle to different Z heights until one "
"feels a small amount of friction when pushing the paper back and forth."
msgstr ""
"床調平的核心校準機制是\"塞紙測試\"。它涉及在列印床和噴嘴之間放置一張普通列印紙，然後將噴嘴控制到不同的Z高度，直到在來回移動紙張時感覺到適量的阻力。"

msgid ""
"It is important to understand the \"paper test\" even if one has an "

msgstr "即使你的印表機帶有自動Z探針，理解塞紙測試依然很重要。爲了保證探針的效果，它經常會需要校準。探針的校準機制也依賴塞紙測試。"

"The first step of the paper test is to inspect the printer's nozzle and bed."

msgid ""
"If there is plastic on the nozzle then heat up the extruder and use a metal "
"tweezers to remove that plastic. Wait for the extruder to fully cool to room"
" temperature before continuing with the paper test. While the nozzle is "
"cooling, use the metal tweezers to remove any plastic that may ooze out."
msgstr ""
"如果噴嘴上殘留了塑料，需要先加熱擠出頭並用金屬鑷子把這些塑料去除。等到擠出機完全冷卻到室溫後，再繼續進行紙張測試。當噴嘴正在冷卻時，使用金屬鑷子去除任何可能漏出的塑料。"

msgid ""
"**Always perform the paper test when both nozzle and bed are at room "

msgstr "**只在噴嘴和列印床都處於室溫的情況下進行塞紙測試！**"

msgid ""
"It may seem odd to calibrate the distance at room temperature when the goal "
"is to have a consistent distance when heated. However, if one calibrates "
"when the nozzle is heated, it tends to impart small amounts of molten "
"plastic on to the paper, which changes the amount of friction felt. That "
"makes it harder to get a good calibration. Calibrating while the bed/nozzle "
"is hot also greatly increases the risk of burning oneself. The amount of "
"thermal expansion is stable, so it is easily accounted for later in the "
"calibration process."
msgstr ""
"當目標是在加熱時有一個一致的距離時，在室溫下校準距離可能聽起來很奇怪。然而，如果在噴嘴加熱時進行校準，往往會有少量的熔融塑料滲入紙張，從而改變了摩擦力的大小。這會影響校準精度。在床或噴嘴熱的時候進行校準也會大大增加燒傷風險。熱膨脹量是穩定的，所以在校準過程中很容易被考慮到。"

msgid ""
"Then a `TESTZ Z=-` would move the nozzle to a Z position of 0.180 (half way "
