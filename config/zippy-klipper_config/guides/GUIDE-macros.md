# The Macros

These are example macros you can use with your slicer to let Klipper manage the start and end procedures.

You can just paste these macros into your `printer.cfg` file.

## Start print macro

    [gcode_macro START_PRINT]
    gcode:
        {% set BED_TEMP = params.BED_TEMP|default(60)|float %}
        {% set EXTRUDER_TEMP = params.EXTRUDER_TEMP|default(190)|float %}
        # Start bed heating (but don't wait for it)
        M140 S{BED_TEMP}
        # Use absolute coordinates
        G90
        # Reset the G-Code Z offset (adjust Z offset if needed)
        SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z=0.0
        # Home the printer
        G28
        # Move the nozzle near the bed
        G1 Z5 F3000
        # Move the nozzle very close to the bed
        G1 Z0.15 F300
        # Wait for bed to reach temperature
        M190 S{BED_TEMP}
        # Set and wait for nozzle to reach temperature
        M109 S{EXTRUDER_TEMP}

## End print macro

    [gcode_macro END_PRINT]
    gcode:
        # Turn off bed, extruder, and fan
        M140 S0
        M104 S0
        M106 S0
        # Move nozzle away from print while retracting
        G91
        G1 X-2 Y-2 E-3 F300
        # Raise nozzle by 10mm
        G1 Z10 F3000
        G90
        # Disable steppers
        M84

These are just the sample start_print and end_print macros copied directly from [the official docs](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/blob/master/config/sample-macros.cfg). I did not change anything and take no credit for these (fairly basic) macros!

# Slicer Settings

These code snippets should be entered in your slicer settings. You should *replace* any existing code in those settings fields with the following.

## Cura Start G-Code

    M109 S0
    M190 S0
    start_print BED_TEMP={material_bed_temperature_layer_0} EXTRUDER_TEMP={material_print_temperature_layer_0}

### Cura End G-Code

    end_print

Note: Cura requires the `M109 S0` and `M190 S0` lines to prevent the slicer from adding it's own M109/M190 commands automatically. This is because Cura doesn't take macros into account and will try to add commands it deems "missing" By setting them each to 0 at the start of the gcode it effectively does absolutely nothing, except to appease Cura and allow your macro to do its job.

## SuperSlicer Start G-Code

    M109 S0
    M190 S0
    start_print BED_TEMP={first_layer_bed_temperature} EXTRUDER_TEMP={first_layer_temperature[initial_extruder] + extruder_temperature_offset[initial_extruder]}

Note: In most cases you could get away with using just `{first_layer_temperature}` for the extruder temp, but the one used above is a better, more inclusive option that will account for edge cases like printers with multiple extruders while also still working perfectly for more traditional builds.

## PrusaSlicer Start G-Code

    M109 S0
    M190 S0
    start_print EXTRUDER_TEMP={first_layer_temperature[initial_extruder]} BED_TEMP={first_layer_bed_temperature[initial_extruder]}

Note: PrusaSlicer recently changed their placeholder/variable formatting. The above applies to PrusaSlicer 2.5.0. For previous versions the SuperSlicer example above should be compatible.
## SuperSlicer/PrusaSlicer End G-Code

    end_print

### Update:

I am now including the `M109`/`M190` dummy commands in the SuperSlicer/PrusaSlicer Start Gcode. PrusaSlicer appears to need them for the same reasons as Cura.

SuperSlicer *shouldn't* when selecting `Klipper` for the G-code Flavor. However, on the latest version the merge with the PrusaSlicer source overwrote this check and it behaves the same way as the others. This has been [confirmed fixed for the next SuperSlicer release](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/issues/875) and I will update the guide when that changes.

It's also worth noting this shouldn't be a serious concern in most cases. At most, allowing the Slicer to automatically add those commands after the macro may just cause a slight hesitation/lag immediately before the print begins.

However, if you wish to do something like offset temperature values using code in your macro, you may have an issue without the dummy commands because the Slicer will set them back at the start of the first layer.

## Why use macros?

There are many benefits to using a start_print macro!

Because the actual code in the slicer will consist of only a call to the macro, it allows you to change the start procedure without reslicing the model.

For example: Let's say you add a bltouch to your printer and you would like to perform a `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE` during your pre-print procedure. You can add that command to your macro and it will be used by all your gcode files, even older ones that were sliced before this change.

You could even use .gcode files on multiple printers with different start requirements so long as each printer has a start_print macro and doesn't have other differences such as temperature or bed size constraints.

It's actually possible to account for those factors as well if you really want to.

Which brings us to the final benefit I'm going to mention:

Macros can use more complex logic that doesn't exist in basic gcode commands that can be used in the slicer start gcode. Using a scripting language called Jinja2, we can perform logic tests in macros (if statements, variables, etc)

Here's a really basic example:

    {% set NOZZLE = printer.extruder.nozzle_diameter|default(0.4)|float %}
    {% if NOZZLE > 0.4 %}
        M220 S75
    {% else %}
        M220 S100
    {% endif %}

This is not a Jinja2 guide, so I will just briefly explain what this does:

The first line gets the nozzle diameter from Klipper using [the Status Reference function described here](https://www.klipper3d.org/Status_Reference.html#toolhead).

It also assigns a default in case it's unable to retrieve that value (unlikely)

Then we test whether the value is greater than 0.4mm.

If it is we set the printing speed to 75%.

Otherwise, we set it to 100%.

This is just a very basic example, Jinja2 allows us to basically write mini-programs that make our macros behave dynamically.

The [Status Reference](https://www.klipper3d.org/Status_Reference.html) functionality in Klipper allows us to retrieve basically ***any*** value the printer can access.

You can even read values directly from the config file, or check whether a `SAVE_CONFIG` is necessary and what items are queued to be saved.

It's pretty powerful stuff, and macros are absolutely worth using!
